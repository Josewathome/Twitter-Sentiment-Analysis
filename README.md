# Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Machine Learning
# Natural Language Processing

## Overview
This project implements a real-time Twitter sentiment analysis tool focused on Machine Learning discussions. It captures the public sentiment towards Machine Learning topics, providing insights into current trends and attitudes in the tech community.

## Features
- Real-time fetching of tweets related to Machine Learning
- Sentiment analysis of tweets (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Asynchronous processing for improved performance
- Presentation of sentiment distribution and sample tweets

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Twikit: For Twitter API interaction
- TextBlob: For sentiment analysis
- Regular Expressions: For text cleaning
- Asyncio: For asynchronous programming

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/Josewathome/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd twitter-ml-sentiment-analysis
3. Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.tx
## Usage
1. Update the `t_code.py` file with your Twitter credentials.
2. Run the script: python t_code.py
3. Enter your search keyword when prompted (e.g., "Machine Learning").

## Sample Output
My search and analysis key word : Machine Learning
- Positive tweets percentage: 55.00%
- Negative tweets percentage: 10.00%
- Neutral tweets percentage: 35.00%

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates proficiency in:
1. Working with social media APIs and handling real-time data streams.
2. Implementing natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis.
3. Developing asynchronous Python applications for improved performance.
4. Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques for unstructured text data.
5. Interpreting and presenting sentiment analysis results in a meaningful way.
6. Understanding the challenges and limitations of automated sentiment analysis, particularly in technical domains.

This project showcases the ability to create practical NLP applications that can provide valuable insights into public opinion on technical topics, a skill highly relevant in today's data-driven tech landscape.
